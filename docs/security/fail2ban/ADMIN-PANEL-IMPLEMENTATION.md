# Fail2Ban Admin Panel Implementation Summary

**Date:** January 2026  
**Branch:** `f2b-manage` (pbx3sbc-admin)  
**Status:** ✅ **CORE FUNCTIONALITY COMPLETE** (Colocated Deployment)

---

## Overview

Successfully implemented Fail2Ban management capabilities in the admin panel, allowing administrators to manage whitelists, view banned IPs, and quickly unban blocked IPs without requiring SSH access.

**Current Deployment:** Admin panel is **colocated** with OpenSIPS server (required for Fail2Ban management).  
**Future Plan:** SSH-based remote execution for decoupled deployment (see [Remote Management Options](REMOTE-MANAGEMENT-OPTIONS.md)).

## Deployment Architecture

### Current: Colocated Deployment

**Requirement:** Admin panel must be installed on the **same server** as OpenSIPS/Fail2Ban.

**Why:**
- Fail2Ban management requires direct file system access (`/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/opensips-brute-force.conf`)
- Fail2Ban commands (`fail2ban-client`) must execute locally
- Service restart (`systemctl restart fail2ban`) requires local access

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ Simple implementation (no network complexity)
- ✅ Secure (no network exposure)
- ✅ Fast (no network latency)
- ⚠️ Testing requires full server setup
- ⚠️ Cannot manage multiple OpenSIPS instances from one admin panel

### Future: Remote Deployment (SSH-Based)

**Plan:** Refactor to support SSH-based remote execution for decoupled deployment.

**Approach:** SSH-based remote execution (see [Remote Management Options](REMOTE-MANAGEMENT-OPTIONS.md))

**Rationale:**
- Message queue (RabbitMQ/Redis) would be more "modern" but is overkill for current needs
- SSH is less "sexy" but simpler, more secure, and uses existing infrastructure
- Supports fleet management (multiple OpenSIPS instances)
- Maintains decoupled architecture principle

**Implementation Timeline:**
1. **Phase 1 (Current):** Colocated deployment - build and test core functionality
2. **Phase 2 (Future):** Refactor services to support SSH executor pattern
3. **Phase 3 (Future):** Add server management (multiple OpenSIPS instances)
4. **Phase 4 (Future):** Deploy admin panel independently

**See:** `REMOTE-MANAGEMENT-OPTIONS.md` for detailed architecture options

## Configuration Required

### 1. Sudoers Configuration

Create `/etc/sudoers.d/pbx3sbc-admin`:

```
# Allow www-data to run fail2ban-client commands without password
www-data ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/fail2ban-client status opensips-brute-force
www-data ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/fail2ban-client set opensips-brute-force banip *
www-data ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/fail2ban-client set opensips-brute-force unbanip *
www-data ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/fail2ban-client set opensips-brute-force unban --all
www-data ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/systemctl restart fail2ban
www-data ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /home/*/pbx3sbc/scripts/sync-fail2ban-whitelist.sh
```

### 2. File Permissions

The web server user (`www-data`) needs write access to:
- `/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/opensips-brute-force.conf`

**Option A:** Add to sudoers (recommended):
```
www-data ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/cp /etc/fail2ban/jail.d/opensips-brute-force.conf*
www-data ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/sed -i*
```

**Option B:** Use group permissions:
```bash
sudo chgrp www-data /etc/fail2ban/jail.d/opensips-brute-force.conf
sudo chmod g+w /etc/fail2ban/jail.d/opensips-brute-force.conf
```

### 3. Database Migration

Run migrations:
```bash
cd pbx3sbc-admin
php artisan migrate
```

## Usage

### Managing Whitelist

1. Navigate to **Fail2Ban Whitelist** in admin panel
2. Click **Create** to add new entry
3. Enter IP/CIDR and optional comment
4. Save - automatically syncs to Fail2Ban

### Viewing Banned IPs

1. Navigate to **Fail2Ban Status** page
2. View list of currently banned IPs
3. Click **Unban** to immediately unban an IP
4. Click **Unban & Whitelist** to unban and prevent future bans

### Quick Unban (Panic Scenario)

1. From dashboard widget or status page, click **Quick Unban**
2. Enter IP address
3. Optionally check "Also add to whitelist"
4. Click **Unban IP**

### Manual Ban

1. Navigate to **Fail2Ban Status** page
2. Enter IP address in "Manual Ban" section
3. Click **Ban IP**

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Run database migrations
- [ ] Configure sudoers file
- [ ] Set file permissions for config file
- [ ] Test whitelist creation (should auto-sync)
- [ ] Test whitelist edit (should auto-sync)
- [ ] Test whitelist deletion (should auto-sync)
- [ ] Test manual sync button
- [ ] Test Fail2Ban status page loads
- [ ] Test quick unban functionality
- [ ] Test "Unban & Whitelist" action
- [ ] Test manual ban functionality
- [ ] Test dashboard widget displays correctly
- [ ] Verify Fail2Ban config file updates correctly
- [ ] Verify Fail2Ban service restarts after sync

## Deployment Notes

### Testing with Colocated Deployment

**Current Limitation:** Admin panel must be on same server as OpenSIPS for testing.

**Workaround for Remote Testing:**
- Use SSH tunnel to simulate local access
- Or accept that full testing requires server deployment
- Focus on unit/integration tests that don't require Fail2Ban

**Future Solution:** SSH-based remote execution will enable true remote testing.

---

## Optional Next Steps

### ⏸️ SSH-Based Remote Execution (Future)

**Status:** Documented, implementation pending

**What's Needed:**
- Refactor `Fail2banService` to use executor pattern (LocalExecutor vs SshExecutor)
- Refactor `WhitelistSyncService` to support remote file operations (SFTP)
- Add `opensips_servers` table for fleet management
- Add server selection UI in admin panel
- Update configuration to support SSH credentials per server

**See:** `REMOTE-MANAGEMENT-OPTIONS.md` for detailed implementation plan

### ⏸️ Permanent Blacklist Management

**Status:** Table created, functionality pending

**What's Needed:**
- `BlacklistSyncService` - Sync database blacklist to firewall rules (iptables/ufw)
- `sync-fail2ban-blacklist.sh` - Script to sync blacklist to permanent firewall rules
- `Fail2banBlacklistResource` - Filament resource for managing permanent bans
- Integration with firewall management (iptables/ufw commands)

**Use Cases:**
- Known bad actors that should never be allowed
- IPs that repeatedly violate after temporary bans expire
- Pre-emptive blocking of known malicious IPs
- Compliance/legal requirements for permanent bans

**Implementation Approach:**
- Database-backed blacklist (similar to whitelist)
- Sync script adds permanent iptables/ufw rules
- Survives Fail2Ban restarts (truly permanent)
- Admin-controlled permanent ban decisions

**Files Needed:**
- `app/Services/BlacklistSyncService.php`
- `scripts/sync-fail2ban-blacklist.sh`
- `app/Filament/Resources/Fail2banBlacklistResource.php`
